Servux
==============
Servux is a server-side Minecraft mod using Fabric that provides extra support/features for some client-side mods when playing on a server.
Servux itself is never needed on the clients or in single player, it's only needed/useful when on the server.
For compiled builds (= downloads), see https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/servux/files
Currently version 0.1.x it only has one thing, which is sending structure bounding boxes for MiniHUD so that it can also render those in multiplayer.

Compiling
=========
* Clone the repository
* Open a command prompt/terminal to the repository directory
* run 'gradlew build'
* The built jar file will be in build/libs/
